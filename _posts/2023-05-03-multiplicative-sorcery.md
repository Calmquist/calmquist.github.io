Previously, I calculated the point costs of the abilities in Psionic Powers. Today's post does the same for Thaumatology: Sorcery. As with the Psionic Powers version, I only recalculated the costs and made no other changes, and I left certain leveled abilities unrounded. I also used the Psionic Powers version of calculating the cost of Innate Attacks with partial dice because it is easier. That may also introduce a slight difference in cost if Sorcery doesn't do it too.

# Air Spells
## Air Jet
**Additive:** 6/level

**Multiplicative:** 3.2375/level

## No-Smell
**Additive:** 63

**Multiplicative:** 52

# Animal Spells
## Animal Control
**Additive:** 10

**Multiplicative:** same

## Repel Animals
**Additive:** 47 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 43.35 + 4.25/additional level

# Body Control
## Haircut
**Additive:** 11

**Multiplicative:** 3

Note: Under Additive Modifiers, Haircut would be a candidate for hardcore improvisation. With Multiplicative Modifiers, it is a good cost for normal improvisation. In neither case would a PC normally take it as a known spell.

## Tanglefoot
**Additive:** 30

**Multiplicative:** 8

# Communication and Empathy
## Gift of Tongues
**Additive:** 28

**Multiplicative:** 26

## Sense Life
**Additive:** 26 or 56

**Multiplicative:** 26 or 51

# Earth
## Flesh to Stone
**Additive:** 61

**Multiplicative:** 40

## Walk Through Earth
**Additive:** 56 or 72

**Multiplicative:** 49 or 61

Note: This conversion was tedious since it required calculating Affliction, Walk Through Earth and Improved Walk Through Earth.

# Enchantment
## Enchant
**Additive:** 37

**Multiplicative:** 8

Note: You can take off the 1/day for the same cost. You can even remove the character point cost for 38 points! GMs should think twice before changing this too much.

## Penetrating Weapon
**Additive:** 44 + 16/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 28.223 + 7.04/additional level

Notes: Imbuement based Weapon Buff advantages cost 19.36, 22.8 or 29.92 + 7.04/level using Multiplicative Modifiers. The cost listed above is entirely unrounded, so actual cost would be a bit higher. Technically, the buff advantage should be calculated, rounded then applied as an enhancement to the Affliction, but that is too much effort. 29 + 8/additional level is easier.

# Fire
## Ignite Fire
**Additive:** 1 or 4

**Multiplicative:** 1 or 2

## Shape Fire
**Additive:** 19/level

**Multiplicative:** 15.4/level

# Gate
## Planar Visit
**Additive:** 30 or 50

**Multiplicative:** 22 or 44

The basic version hits the -80% limitation limit exactly while the improved version drops the limitation to -60%.

## Suspend Time
**Additive:** 141 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 107.625 + 3.75/level

Note: Suspend Time is a great candidate for additional limitations.

# Healing
## Minor Healing
**Additive:** 32

**Multiplicative:** 18

## Relieve Madness
**Additive:** 10

**Multiplicative:** no change

# Illusion and Creation
## Complex Illusion
**Additive:** 42 + 12.5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 38.25 + 10.625/additional level

## Create object
**Additive:** 56 + 4/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 41.6 + 1.6/additional level

# Knowledge
## Detect Magic
**Additive:** 7

**Multiplicative:** no change

## Divination
**Additive:** 48 or 98

**Multiplicative:** 20 or 35

Note: The -70% limitations combined with the improved version having an enhancement explains the cost difference.

# Light and Darkness
## Light
**Additive:** 11 + 4/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 8 + 2/additional level

## Sunbolt
**Additive:** 4/level

**Multiplicative:** no change

# Making and Breaking
## Disintegrate
**Additive:** 47

**Multiplicative:** 38

## Inspired Creation
**Additive:** 30

**Multiplicative:** 27

Note: Inspired Creation's buff advantage has no enhancements, so this calculation was relatively simple.

# Meta
## Dispel Magic
**Additive:** 60 + 25/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 24.375 + 6.25/additional level

## Remove Curse
**Additive:** 65

**Multiplicative:** 21

## Scryguard
**Additive:** 68

**Multiplicative:** 57

# Mind Control
## Lesser Geas
**Additive:** 54

**Multiplicative:** 48

Note: This one has a built in Limited Enhancement! These would be more common for abilities designed for use with Multiplicative Modifiers to limit abilities while avoiding the -80% limitation cap.

## Terror 
**Additive:** 45 + 15/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 42.075 + 14.025/additional level

# Movement
## Grease
**Additive:** 45 + 15/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 30 + 6/additional level

Note: This is quite a bit less costly. The extra levels do exceed the -80% cap slightly.

## Locksmith
**Additive:** 10

**Multiplicative:** no change

# Necromantic
## Steal Vitality
**Additive:** 19 + 3/additional level

**Multiplicative:** no change

## Turn Zombie
**Additive:** 47 + 7.5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 7.875 + 10 + 1.25/additional level + 1/additional level

# Plant
## Blight
**Additive:** 44 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 22.275 + 2.25/additional level

## Body of Wood
**Additive:** 98

**Multiplicative:** 85

Note: The Body of Wood meta-trait doesn't change with Multiplicative Modifiers.

# Protection and Warning
## Magelock
**Additive:** 25 + 15/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 7 + 3/additional level

Notes: This one exceeds the -80% limitation limit. The added DR has a limitation but no enhancement, so its cost doesn't change.

## Reverse Missiles
**Additive:** 75 + 63/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 51.425 + 39.95/additional level

Note: This cost is decreased significantly. The -40% on the Reverse Missiles advantage is significant.

# Sound
## Delayed Message
**Additive:** 38

**Multiplicative:** 34

## Thunderclap
**Additive:** 36 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 25 + 3/additional level

# Technology
## Awaken Computer
**Additive:** 45/level

**Multiplicative:** 40.5/level

## Preserve Fuel
**Additive:** 45 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 22.725 + 2.25/additional level

# Water
## Icy Weapon
**Additive:** 14

**Multiplicative:** 12

Note: Unlike the Imbuement based Weapon Buffs, this one has no enhancements in the buff advantage (besides the +0% one that doesn't change cost).

## Whirlpool
**Additive:** 6/level

**Multiplicative:** 2.8/level

# Weather
## Cool
**Additive:** 7 + 5/additional level, 14 + 10/additional level, 21 + 15/additional level, 28 + 20/additional level or 35 + 25/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 4.725 + 1.75/additional level, 9.45 + 3.5/additional level, 14.175 + 5.25/additional level, 18.9 + 7/additional level or 23.625 + 8.75/additional level

Notes: This one was obviously one of the more tedious conversions. It is significantly less costly and does exceed the -80% limitation cap.

## Predict Weather
**Additive:** 13 or 25

**Multiplicative:** 8 or 11

# Multiplicative Sorcerous Empowerment
Sorcerous Empowerment is its own advantage, but what would its cost be if designed using Multiplicative Modifiers? This is more for fun than a recommendation. See the Under the Hood box on Thaumatology: Sorcery p. 5 to see how this is done.

**Multiplicative Sorcerous Empowerment:** 17.6 + 8.8/additional level

This isn't much of a difference. I suggest sticking to the pentaphilic version. It would make regular Improvisation less costly, but Known Spells and Hardcore Improvisation both rely on total cost.

# Final Thoughts
These calculations were much simpler than the Psionic Powers ones although there may be a few errors. The most complicated part was remembering to use the Multiplicative Modifiers for the advantage bestowed by the buffs before calculating Affliction's cost.

Multiplicative Modifiers has the potential to incentivize designing spells with more restrictive rituals such as Requires Gestures, Requires Magic Words, Requires Material Component, etc. or limitations meant to make Sorcery act more like Magic as Skills magic such as Requires (Attribute) Roll, Short-Range, etc. Some existing spells could benefit from those limitations, but many already hit the -80% limitation cap.

Multiplicative Modifier Sorcery would benefit from spells designed with said modifiers in mind.

Some abilities may be designed differently if intended for use with Multiplicative Modifiers, but these worked fairly well. I will leave converting Enraged Eggplant's collection to someone else.
