Today's post is some updates to the House Verge legacy and some other details.

See [part 1](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/09/23/house-verge-1.html) for a broad overview of House Verge, [part 2](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/09/30/house-verge-2.html) for a little more detail and [part 3](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/11/11/house-verge-3.html) for initial cultural and historical details, [part 4](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/01/27/house-verge-4.html) for additional historical and cultural details, [part 5](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/04/13/house-verge-5.html) for non psionic traits, [part 6](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/05/13/house-verge-6.html) for supernatural traits and [part 7](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/07/15/house-verge-7.html) for other options.

# Eugenic Legacy
The non psionic portion of the Eugenic Legacy for Verge, Colttrodder and Lawbright is mostly identical. 

House Colttrodder replaces Verge Cunning with Colttrodder Acumen. Swap Born Tactician with Business Acumen.

House Lawbright replaces Verge Cunning with Lawbright Savvy. Swap Born Tactician with Occultist.

# Psionic Legacy
Updated Psionic Legacy traits:

**Bloodline Purity 0**: Gecko Grip [1], Small Scale TK [1], Strong Blade [1], Tactile TK [5/level], TK Tether [1]

**Blood Purity 1**: TK Blast [4/level], TK Grab [2/level]

**Blood Purity 3**: Compartmentalized mind (Accessibility, Conscious Only -5%; Costs 3 fatigue -15%; Limited, One Ability, TK-Grab -30%; No Mental Separation -20%; Requires IQ Roll -10%) [10]

**Blood Purity 4**: Psychokinesis Talent +1 to +4 [5/level]

Colttrodder Psionic Legacy is identical to Verge. Lawbright is significantly different, but I haven't decided on the details yet. Lawbright focuses on sorcery rather than traditional psionics.

# Ranathim Bloodline
Characters with Bloodline (Verge, Colttrodder or Lawbright) are all hybrids with ranathim and thus must take some ranthim traits as part of their racial template. Normally, the Verge bloodline "suppresses" the natural Psychic Vampirism of the ranathim bloodline, so they normally do not take Uncontrollable Appetite (Psionic Energy) as a disadvantage (though Colttrodder are sometimes exceptions). They may take up to -7 in some other "hunger" disadvantage as part of their racial template instead. These rules replace the ranathim power-ups from part 5.

In addition, characters with sufficiently tailored ranathim bloodline have access to the following eugenic package:

## Cultivated Ranathim Bloodline (Verge, Colttrodder or Lawbright) [2]
**Perks:** Ranathim Bloodline (Verge, Colttrodder or Lawbright), Ranathim Compatibility

## Ranathim Bloodline (Verge, Colttrodder or Lawbright)
This counts as a level of Bloodline Purity (House) for all purposes except that the reaction bonus applies to people looking for a sufficiently pure ranathim bloodline rather than a Maradonian bloodline. Ranathim Bloodline (Verge and Colttrodder) are identical for game purposes, but Ranathim Bloodline (Lawbright) is not interchangeable.

## Ranathim Compatibility
You count as ranathim for mystical or technological effects that operate on ranathim even if they do not normally work on hybrids. In addition, you can gain Psychic Vampirism perks and can use psychotronics that require Psychic Vampirism.

# Verge Names
House Verge uses both Maradonian and Lithian names. They typically prefer older "Romanesque" names such as Gaius, Julius, Plinia or Sennia for their Maradonian names and "antique" Lithian names such as Brina, Milsene, Brinthim or Hela. This is only a loose guideline however. Some Verge may even have Westerly names, and they also use more common Maradonian names like Jace or Nova when they aren't trying to make themselves out to be "especially traditional."

House Colttrodder follows the same guidelines except that they are increasingly more likely to use more modern Lithian names and Lithian names in general. House Lawbright sometimes uses "theatrical" or "mystically significant" names.
