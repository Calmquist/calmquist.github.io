Yes, that was necessary.

Pyramid #3/13 introduced the Mystic Knight occupational template for Dungeon Fantasy, and Pyramid #3/36 expanded the Mystic Knight with Mystic Archer and Mystic Swordsman lenses for Scout and Swashbuckler respectively. Today's post contains upgrade modules in the style of Delvers to Grow for Mystic Archer, Mystic Knight, Mystic Swordsman.

There is certainly room to quibble about the specific packaging of these modules, and the module names aren't particularly creative, but this is at least a decent startiing point. And yes, I did list some GURPS modifiers. For Dungeon Fantasy RPG, simply give the limited Imbue advantage a fancy name and hide the details.

These abilities are suitable for Martial Artists, but the modules may need to be modified for Martial Artists who want Chi Talent instead of a more limited Chi Imbuement Talent. 

# Mystical
**Prerequisite:** Knight, Scout or Swashbuckler

**Advantages:** Eldritch Talent 1 [5]; Imbue 2 (Limited Skill Application, Weapon of Choice, -50%; Magical, -10%) [8]; Magery 0 [5]

**Skills:** 7 points in Imbuements skills

# More Mystical
**Prerequisite:** Mystical

**Advantages:** Upgrade Eldritch Talent 1 to Eldritch Talent 3 for 10 pointsl Upgrade Imbue 2 to Imbue 3 (Limited Skill Application, Weapon of Choice, -50%; Magical, -10%) for 8 points

**Skills**: 7 more points in Imbuement skills

Spend any leftover points on adding additional weapon skills for Imbue for 4 points each (maximum of 3 additional weapons for 12 points, all melee or all ranged for 16 for 16 points or all weapons for 20 points) or on Imbuement skills

# Even More Mystical
**Prerequisites:** More Mystical and Knight II, Scout II or Swashbuckler II

**Advantages:** Upgrade Eldritch Talent 3 to Eldritch Talent 4 for 5 points;

Spend any leftover points on adding additional weapon skills for Imbue for 4 points each (maximum of 3 additional weapons for 12 points, all melee or all ranged for 16 for 16 points or all weapons for 20 points), Imbuement skills or increasing Eldritch Talent to 5 or 6 for 5 or 10 points.

# Using the Upgrades
A Scout only ever needs one weapon skill for imbuements: the bow, and there are many good imbuements available at level 2. There are plenty of opportunities to save points on mystical upgrades to spend on shooting faster and with higher skill level.

Many Swashbucklers will also only ever need imbuement skills for their chosen sword skill, but some may want imbuements for their bucklers.

Knights are the most likely candidates for the full Imbuement advantage. They may also consider taking Imbuement for all melee weapons to violating the Scout's niche.
