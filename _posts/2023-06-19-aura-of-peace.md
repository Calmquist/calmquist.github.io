While attempting to design a somewhat complicated ability, I decided I could make a simpler version using Auras of Power from Pyramid 3/19.

# Aura of Peace
**28 points**

_Divine Elements:_ Peace

_Skill:_ Prayer of Peace (Will/Hard).

By channeling power from the gods of peace, the cleric can prevent hostile actions around him. Those affected by the aura may only use forceful action in defense of themselves or others and may only use as much force as necessary for such defense.

_Statistics:_ Affliction 1 (HT; Aura of Power 1, +175%; Pacifism (Self Defense Only), +15%; PM, -10%) [28]

## Expanded Area
**Hard**

_Default:_ Prayer of Peace-5; cannot exceed Prayer of Peace.

This works like the technique of the same name for any other aura.

## Total Peace
**Hard**

_Default:_ Prayer of Peace-3; cannot exceed Prayer of Peace.

Those affected by this aura cannot take _any_ violent action against sapient creatures for _any_ reason.

# Telepathic Auras
Some of the auras _may_ make sense as Telepathy abilities, but they require some minor modifications. Add Based on Will and No Signature for +40%. Suitable auras include:

* Aura of Chaos
* Aura of Courage
* Aura of Cowardice
* Aura of Fascination
* Aura of Focus
  * Adding Will is a bit cheesy, but it is probably not unbalanced without some sort of overlaping aura exploit
* Aura of Illusion
* Aura of Peace

Whether or not these abilities _are_ suitable for a particular power depends on the nature of the power and the setting.

# Designer Notes
Everything should be obvious. I may do a post about the more complicated ability in the future.

The material presented here is my original creation, intended for use with the [GURPS](https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) system from [Steve Jackson Games](https://www.sjgames.com/). This material is not official and is not endorsed by Steve Jackson Games.
