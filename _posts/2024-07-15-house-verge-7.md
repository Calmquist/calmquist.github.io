While I was thinking about relics, important House members and destiny, [Chivare](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:chivare-as-power-up) was released to the Psi-Wars wiki. I had some Chivare related ideas for House Verge and its cadets, so today's post is about some additional character options.

See [part 1](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/09/23/house-verge-1.html) for a broad overview of House Verge, [part 2](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/09/30/house-verge-2.html) for a little more detail and [part 3](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/11/11/house-verge-3.html) for initial cultural and historical details, [part 4](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/01/27/house-verge-4.html) for additional historical and cultural details, [part 5](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/04/13/house-verge-5.html) for non psionic traits and [part 6](https://calmquist.github.io/2024/05/13/house-verge-6.html) for supernatural traits.

# [Diplomat](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:diplomat)
For Verge diplomats, consider the Diplomat to the Alien Potentates of the Dark Arm optional lens. Naturally, Verge's main contacts are in the Umbral Rim. Verge sends envoys mainly to neighboring constellations. House Colttrodder has established decent relationships with several [slaver](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:slavers) warlords. Verge has attempted to establish friendly relations with the [loroko](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:loroko), but most are not enthused.

When creating a diplomat, keep in mind that Verge culture is a blend of Lithian and Maradonian cultures developed for centuries without outside contact from humanity.

# [Fighter Ace](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:fighter-ace)
House Verge does not have access to ARC nor does it have any special Valkyrie variant. Verge fighters do tend to make use of [amulets](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:lithian-amulets) to protect their ships.

Despite the Astral Spiral not being part of the Alliance by default, the Alliance Ace lens is appropriate.

# [Chiva](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:chiva)/[Sorcerer](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:sorcerer)
In the Astral Spiral, chiva refers to any female who practices sorcery regardless of specific tradition. Likewise, zathan refers to any male who practices any sorcerous tradition. Zathan don't have the same social regard as chiva, but they are not regarded with any particular suspicion. Verge practices a Lithian magic cultivated and modified by Akashic eugenics and other "tricks." They tend to treat it as a special type of psionic power. It is a useful tool that can aid in averting "the Coming Storm" and pursuing "the Golden Path," but not more important than psionic power.

House Lawbright's chiva fill the role of the Lithian Chiva and the Maradonian Akashic Oracles. Verge (including Lawbright) typically do not have access to [blood sorcery](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:blood-sorcery) since the same genes that suppress psychic vampirism also seem to suppress blood sorcery. They are also not typically witch-born, but the Lawbright may have a unique "born" lens.

I have an idea for a Storm Sorcery tradition inspired by the regular storms on Tempest, but it is still in the initial concept stage. Lawbright from Tempest might replace Blood Sorcery with Storm Sorcery.

# [Space Knight](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:space-knight)
Unlike many other important Maradonian Houses, House Verge does not have access to ARC. Verge does not have the cool [Maradonian space knight armor](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:maradonian-space-knight-armor), so Verge space knights tend to be armored about as well as typical Lithian Satemo. However, Verge has managed to obtain at least one [flesh carapace](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ferthe-dapolor) over the centuries. Instead of special armor, they tend to rely on [protective amulets](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:lithian-amulets) created by the Lawbright chiva.

## Maradonian Space Knight
The Maradonian Space Knight lens is a solid choice for Verge space knights. Use this lens for Verge with strong bloodlines and particularly powerful telekinesis. This is a pretty obvious standard option.

## Satemo
Verge (particularly Verge with relatively weak telekinesis) knights are often enhanced through secret, powerful oaths. Replace the Divine Masks specialties with Akashic Mysteries. Add Astral Spiral as an optional Law specialty. Replace the Code of Honor with a more appropriate oath related to an Ancestral Destiny or an oath to the Akashic Order or a specific chiva. Replace the Unconscious Communion with an appropriate Ancestral Destiny or with the Oath Sorcery perk. Verge Satemo typically get oath-bound sorcery buffs instead of Communion oaths.

House Lawbright typically has weak or no telekinetic abilities. Lawbright knights usually take the Satemo lens with Oath Sorcery instead of strong telekinetic abilities.

Verge with the Enthir Edict use that in place of the Code of Honor and Cursed. It already contains those and the Oath Magic perk.

## Witch Knight
House Lawbright was formed from Verge with relatively weak telekinetic abilities and a stronger affinity for sorcery. Lawbright produces an unusually high number of chiva/zathan children. The Akashic eugenics project was largely successful, but it was imperfect. Some are only able to use a few spells and sometimes become witch knights. I plan to work out the details when I create the Lawbright Sorcerous Legacy traits later.

It is possible that someone with significant sorcerous ability might walk the path of a space knight. Occult Empowerment, talent, casting skills and known spells would be a significant investment, but it should be possible for a PC to make a "full" witch knight. For House Lawbright, I suspect zathan would follow this path more frequently than chiva due to social reasons, but I would certainly allow either option for a PC. Such a witch knight could even have a witch blade that is essentially a psi sword with damage based on Occult Empowerment level and with the damage type and effect based on a particular blade spell.

# [Corporate Heir](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:corporate-heir)
House Colttrodder manages a significant portion of the trade in the Astral Spiral and has several businesses. Colttrodder characters may optionally take the Corporate Heir lens rather the standard Aristocrat lens.

# [Survivor](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:survivor)
While most Verge are Aristocrats, Survivor may be an appropriate lens for characters from Tempest. It is definitely an appropriate lens for non Verge in the Astral Spiral.

# Notes
I had most of these ideas before the Chivare wiki update and the related [blog post](https://mailanka.wordpress.com/2024/07/13/wiki-update-chivare/) and decided that I should write them sooner rather than later.
