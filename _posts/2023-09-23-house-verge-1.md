Today's post is an introduction to my custom Maradonian House for Psi-Wars. If you are unfamiliar with Psi-Wars, the best place to start is the [primer](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:primer) on the wiki. The [Mailanka's Musings](https://mailanka.wordpress.com/) blog is a great source of Psi-Wars design information.

This won't be a faction design tutorial, but it may give some ideas for how to develop a faction in an existing setting.

# House Verge's Development
I have been developing House Verge slowly for quite a while now. I was asked some questions about it a while ago, so I decided to write about it. Its current state is a simple premise with various ideas thrown together into a vaguely coherent faction. I will be developing House Verge from the basic premises and apply Psi-Wars setting logic with the goal of developing House Verge into a more interesting faction.

# [Maradonian Houses](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:aristocratic-houses)
In Psi-Wars, a Maradonian House is a family of space aristocrats. For details, see the wiki page hyperlinked above. Maradonian Houses are pretty cool. They typically share a few features:

* Rule of a planet or perhaps group of planets
  * Some could be vassels that rule part of a planet for a lord
* Eugenically developed psionic abilities
  * [House Kain](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:house-kain) is a notable exception that relies on cybernetics instead
* Non psionic eugenic traits
  * Maradonian Houses are similar to Human racial templates except that the traits are optional power-ups instead being mandatory for all members of the House
* Cool gear
  * Special weapons and armor
  * Mysterious family heirlooms imbued with the power of Communion
* Special destinies
* Other special traits
* Player hooks

As a Maradonian House, House Verge will eventually have a bunch of neat things that players and GMs will be able to use.

# Basic Premise
I originally conceived the idea for House Verge back when Psi-Wars had the first four Maradonian Houses. I wanted to create another House with a few simple features:

* Relatively minor
* Psychokinetic
  * Emphasis on TK-Grab
* Uses [Psychokinetic Force Swordsmanship](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psionic-force-swordsmanship#toc16) style
* Interacts with [Satemo](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:space-knight#toc6)

# Additional Concepts
Beyond the basics, I had a few additional ideas that followed closely from the original premises:

* Terratory deep in the Umbral Rim
  * Separated from the Alliance
* Genetically compatible with [Ranathim](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ranathim)

I will expand on these ideas in future posts in the series.
