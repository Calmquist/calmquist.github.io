Psionic powers can have abilities that do basically the same things in slightly different ways. Today's post converts some Photokinesis abilities to Umbrakinesis.

# Umbral Fantasm

_Skill:_ Fantasm (IQ/Hard)

You can rearrange the shadows in a two-yard area to produce believable, moving illusions. This ability works like the Hologram ability (Psionic Powers, pp. 35-36) except that it requires a sufficient amount of darkness (i.e., darkness penalty of -1 or worse). It can work in total darkness by "controlling the shadows" to "produce sufficient light" to allow the illusion to be meaningful. It can't create a Flash type effect like Hologram, but it can produce startling shadow effects. If your GM agrees that the illusion is sufficiently startling, make a Quick Contest of Fantasm vs the higher of your targets IQ or Perception. If you win, your target must make a Fright Check. The modifiers from Powers p. 94 apply.

_Statistics:_ As Hologram except replace the Environmental limitation with Environmental, Darkness, -10% and the Power Modifier with Necrokinesis, -10%

# Tenebrism
**4.8/level**; **4.16/level** using Multiplicative Modifiers

_Skill:_ Tenebrism (IQ/Hard)

You cloak the area around you in darkness and shadow. This works exactly the same as Photorefraction (Psionic Powers, pp. 36-37) except that it is only Stealthy in a sufficient amount of darkness (i.e., darkness penalty of -1 or worse). The darkness need not be natural, but darkness but it must not come from _this_ ability. 

_Statistics:_ As Photorefraction except that the Stealthy enhancement is limited by Environmental, Darkness, -10% and the Power Modifier is replaced by Necrokinesis, -10%.

The Blocking variant is available, as is an additional non-stealthy variant.

# Designer Notes
The conversions were low effort, but there were enough minor tweaks in special effects to make the changes interesting. Realistically, Tenebrism shouldn't be stealthy without a significant amount of darkness. Setting a different minimum level is left as an exercise for the reader.
