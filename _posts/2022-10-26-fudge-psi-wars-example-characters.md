title: "Fudge Psi-Wars Example Characters"

I have been contemplating Psi-Wars in Fudge for a while and have been writing some ideas on how to do the conversion. In the course of writing my ideas, I decided that some simple gameplay examples would be helpful. These are some characters that will feature in some future examples.

I created the characters using Subjective Character Creation for all of the traits except skills. I didn't worry much about cost or balance. 

For skills, I used Five-Point Fudge with mostly "default" skill categories. I did this to see what I could make fairly quickly using Five-Point Fudge.

Don't worry too much about the specific details of the Gifts, Faults and Supernormal Abilities. Also, don't worry about the skill specialties, breadth and overlap. Specific details can be refined later.

"I don't con people! It isn't my fault that they make deals without understanding them. People should pay more attention. It's common sense! And that was not breaking and entering! I asked the door, and it let me in. Sure, I convinced it that its owner needed me to get something for him and that I forgot my key and was in a hurry. The door should have made sure the owner sent me. That's no reason to put me in a cell! This cell is boring. It has mechanical locks. I tried talking to them, but they don't talk back."

Note: The Good Climb is due to racial bonus.

# Noriko Tan-Shai: Eldothic Researcher

  * Good Rank
  * Good Wealth
  * Fair Status

In public, Noriko Tan-Shai is a renowned researcher and engineer. Secretly, she has ties to an Exarch and is a pioneer in Deep Engine technology. One day, she was abducted by "pirates" (definitely not affiliated with the Cybernetic Union; That would be absurd!). So far, no ransom has been announced. What will be her fate, and what do her captors want?

Note: Noriko's negative scale is due to the combination of being a noodle-armed researcher combined with eldothic genetics.

Yuanto Zero comes from a family of Shinei who sided with Leto Daijin. He was subjected to harsh Shineido training from his youth. He is always vigilant. Unfortunately, that constant vigilance also led to paranoia. During his first day off in over a year, his charge was abducted by pirates. His superiors have instructed him to wait for a ransom note, but the note is late. Yuanto Zero embarks to find his charge...

Note: I sort of cheated with Read Opponent by "trading backwards" and dropping a Fair skill.
