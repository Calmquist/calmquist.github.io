Today's post contains miscellaneous perk level psionic abilities.

# Animal Telepathy
## Cognitive Parry
An Animal Telepathy variant of the Telepathy perk (below) may exist for defending against _non sapient_ creatures, but it isn't as useful unless your setting tends to have animals that make attacks that are too fast to parry.

## Call of the Wild (Power-Ups 2, p. 12)
This is suitable for Animal Telepathy.

# Ergokinesis
## Laser Pointer
You can focus light into a small beam. This is mostly useful for pointing at distant objects. If shined in someone's eyes, treat it as a Dazzler Laser (Ultra-Tech, p. 113). The GM is free to treat offensive use as a Dirty Trick (B405). 

## Parasol
You can reduce the light in a small area to create an effect similar to shade. It won't help with stealth but it can prevent sunburn and give +1 to HT for resisting heat in the sun. You can produce enough shade to cover yourself or another person with 1 yard.

# Necrokinesis
## Covenant of Rest (Power-Ups 2, p. 19)
This is a suitable perk for Animakinesis and Necrokinesis.

## Parasol
Parasol is also an Umbrakinesis ability (and _should_ be called "umbrella," but that name was taken by the PK perk).

## Rest in Pieces (Power-Ups 2, p. 19)
This is also suitable for Anaimakinesis and Necrokinesis.

# Psychokinesis
## Haptic Feedback
_Prerequisite:_ TK-Grab

You have a vague sense of contact with your TK-Grab "hands." You are able to determine if an object is roughly solid or liquid but are not able to determine more specific details such as firmness and texture. This sense can help you detect illusions and invisible objects but it isn't sensitive enough to read braille. You are also unable to sense temperature.

## Thermometer
You are able to sense temperature with great accuracy and precision. Take a Concentrate maneuver and make and roll IQ (plus talent) at -1/yard of distance. If you succeed, you can judge the temperature as if you used a sophisticated thermometer for your setting.

## Third Hand
You can use your TK to help when your hands are full. This functions exactly like Akimbo (Power-Ups 2, p. 5).

# Telepathy
## Cognitive Parry
_Prerequisite:_ Precognitive Parry

You can add your Telepathy talent to your Precognitive Parry skill provided the attack comes from a sapient creature within 100 yards. An attacker with the Mind Shield advantage may resist with Will to negate the effect. Naturally, a Psi Static resists automatically.

## Presence
You can amplify your voice in people's minds. This functions like Penetrating Voice (Power-Ups 2, p. 14).
