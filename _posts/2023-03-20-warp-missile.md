# Warp Missile 2 points/level
_Skill:_ Warp Missile (IQ/H)

You are able to teleport missile attacks away from yourself to some harmless location. When there is a missile attack made against you and you are aware of it, you may roll against Warp Missile/2 + 3 + 1 for Combat Reflexes. You roll at -4 if stunned and at a cumulative -4 penalty for each successive use after the first on a given turn. If you succeed, you may negate the attack by warping it somewhere harmless as long as its basic damage (in dice) does not exceed the value in the table below. If the base damage does exceed this value, this ability provides _no_ defense.

|Level|Damage|Level|Damage|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1|1d-3|8|2d+1|
|2|1d-2|9|2d+2|
|3|1d-1|10|2d+3|
|4|1d|11|3d|
|5|1d+1|12|3d+1|
|6|1d+2|13|3d+2|
|7|2d|14|4d|

The progression continues using Modifying Dice + Adds on B269.

If you first roll fails, additional attempts cost 1 FP until you succeed or wait 5 minutes. If your FP drop to 3 or less from this cost, you may not use this ability until you regain _all_ of your FP.

You may use this ability only if you would be able to make an active defense, but it is separate from any active defenses. You may choose to use this ability at any time before or after any active defense you make.

You may also choose to use this ability as your active defense with a Power Block. If so, double the level of this ability against that attack. You get no other active defense unless you chose the All-Out Defense (Double Defense) maneuver _even if you fail because the attack exceeds your capacity_.

_Statistics:_ Damage Resistance (Active Defense, -40; All or Nothing, -10%; Force Field, +20%; Limited, Missiles, -20%; Teleportation, -10%) [2/level]

## Expansion
**Hard**

**Default:** Warp Missile -5; cannot exceed Warp Missile

If you succeed with this technique, you may defend others against any missile attacks within a two yard radius of you. For each 5 points by which you succeed, double the radius. This technique halves you effective level.

## Reflection
**Hard**

**Default:** Warp Missile -5; cannot exceed Warp Missile

Reduce your level by half. If this ability would still stop the attack, you warp the attack so that it fires back at the attacker. If the attacker is unaware of this ability, he gets no defense against this the first time use use this technique. He may defend normally against subsequent uses.

If the GM allows, you may instead quarter you level and take an additional -8 penalty which can be bought off. If the ability would still stop the attack, you warp the attack so that it originates behind the attacker. Characters with 360Â° vision or Peripheral Vision can defend normally, and characters with Danger Sense may defend at -2 with a successful Perception roll. Others get no defense!

## Suppression
**Hard**

**Default:** Warp Missile -5; cannot exceed Warp Missile

This works like the EK Shield and PK Shield techniques, except that it protects against teleportation based attacks (e.g. [Interportation](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/02/27/two-scientific-attacks.html) or Innerportation, Psionic Powers p. 70).

# Designer Notes
The Active Defense limitation normally requires a DX roll, but using an IQ roll is acceptable for a psionic ability as a special effect.

The expansion to the Reflection technique adds the Stealthy enhancement.

In addition to the enhancements in the other Suppression techniques, the one for Warp Missile swaps the Limited, Missiles for Limited, Teleportation. I kept the penalty the same for simplicity and because it is at least "close enough." Since this is an "active defense" type ability, there may be a clever way to reduce the cost. The +0% version of Malediction-Proof would work as long as no Cosmic, Irresistible Attack attacks exist in the setting. Alternatively, some special Only Against Cosmic or Maledictions could work, but I am not sure on the cost of that enhancement.
