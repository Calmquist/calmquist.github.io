Here, I present a certain two scientific attack abilities for the Ergokinesis and Teleportation powers. The former is trivial, but the latter took a significant amount of effort and design.

# EK Railgun 
_Skill:_ EK Railgun (IQ/Hard)

You can launch nearby small, ferreous objects and launch them at high speeds like a railgun. This ability requires ferreous objects and is part of the Ergokinesis power but is otherwise identical to TK Bullet.

The Environmental limitation is slightly more restrictive than TK Bullet, so you may be able to Fast-Talk your GM into increasing it to -15%. You will need a substantial bribe to get -20%.

One may consider adding an inherent armor divisor to make the ability work like a typical railgun in GURPS. This is certainly an option, but some objects such as coins may not warrant the armor divisor.

# Interportation #0 10/12/12/13/14/16/18/20/22 for levels 1-9
_Skill:_ Interportation (IQ/Hard)

You can teleport objects around the size of a small knife that you touch directly inside of your target. Make an attack roll using the Interaportation Skill. If you hit, make a quick contest of Interportation vs HT applying the standard range penalty to your skill (p. B550). If you win, you inflict 1d-2 impaling damage to your target. You may aim your attack at specific body parts. The attack is invisible and appears inside the body instantly. If the target is somehow aware of the attack, he may dodge at -4. Otherwise, he gets no defense.

The rate of fire is based on level shown in the table below:

|  Level  |    RoF     | Skill Bonus |
|---------|------------|-------------|
|    1    |     1      |      +0     |
|    2    |     2      |      +0     |
|    3    |     3      |      +0     |
|    4    |     6      |      +1     |
|    5    |     12     |      +2     |
|    6    |     24     |      +4     |
|    7    |     48     |      +5     |
|    8    |     96     |      +6     |
|    9    |     192    |      +7     |

The high rate of fire can get out of hand. The GM is encouraged to set a maximum level for this ability.

The Spray Fire option is available to you but Suppression Fire is not since you teleport objects directly into the target (see p. B409). 

_Statistics:_ Impaling Attack 1d-2 (Based on HT, +20%; Based on IQ, Own Roll, +20%; Malediction 2, +150%; Selective Effect, +20%; Teleportation, -10%; No Signature, +20%; Limited Use, 3-4 Uses, Fast Reload, -10%) [10]. Level 2 adds Rapid Fire, RoF 2 [12]. Level 3 replaces Rapid Fire, RoF 2 with Rapid Fire, RoF 3 [12]. Level 4 replaces Rapid Fire, RoF 3 with Rapid Fire, RoF 6 and adds Selective Fire. Further levels double the RoF.

## Careful Selection
**Hard**

_Default:_ Interportation-2; cannot exceed Interportation

You can choose to avoid hitting targets in the area when using the Spray Fire option.

## Thoughts
I don't like this version. It far too many rolls. Weaponized Malediction + Rapid Fire may be compatible by the rules, but they require far too many rolls when combined.

# Interportation #1 17/19/19/20/21/23/25/27/29 for levels 1-9
_Skill:_ Interportation (IQ/H)

As Interportation \#0, but replace Malediction and Weaponized with Cosmic (Irresistible Attack) and remove the 1/2D range. This version ignores DR and skips the Quick Contests and has a max range of 100 yards.

## Thoughts
This version costs a bit more but has far fewer rolls. Rapid Fire of invisible projectiles that ignore DR is easy to abuse. GMs who wish to allow this ability need to limit RoF to something manageable. As a minor variant, reduce the maximum range to 20 yards.

# Interportation #2
Interportation is a natural Alternate Attack for Exoteleport. Why not make it a technique?

## Interportation
**Hard**

_Default:_ Exoteleport-4; cannot exceed Exoteleport

This technique is either of the above versions with RoF 3 converted to a technique. The technique default should technically vary based on Exoteleport level. The technique cost is based on Exoteleport level 1.

## Thoughts
This one is fairly simple except that the default cost doesn't work well. We could increase the Interportation level based on Exoteleport's level, but that would get out of hand quickly, and the cost of the Interportation abilities doesn't vary much by level.

# Interportation #3 10 points per level
_Skill:_ Interportation(IQ/H)

Instead of basing level on RoF and having fixed damage, we can have fixed RoF and base level on the size of the object teleported and thus the damage dealt.

Level 1 is identical to Interportation \#0 at level 1. Further levels simply increase damage.

_Statistics:_ Impaling Attack 1d-2 (Based on HT, +20%; Based on IQ, Own Roll, +20%; Malediction 2, +150%; Selective Effect, +20%; Teleportation, -10%; No Signature, +20%; Limited Use, 3-4 Uses, Fast Reload, -10%) [10/level].

## Thoughts
This ability is similar to Innerportation but is more subtle and requires an attack roll.

# Interportation #4 17 points per level
_Skill:_ Interportation(IQ/H)

This is to Interportation \#1 as Interportation \#3 is to Interportation \#0.

## Thoughts
This one twice the cost of Innerporation and still requires an attack roll to hit, but it is bypasses DR without a QC and is very difficult to defend. Unlike the previous version, it can take a Rapid Fire technique if you really want increased RoF.

# Designer Notes
I am dissatisfied with the techniques for TK Bullet and thus EK Railgun, but this was an example of reflavoring an ability, and Interportation was difficult enough without trying to fix TK Bullet too. An alternative to using techniques for the various damage types for TK Bullet/EK Railgun is to buy the alternate damage types as alternate attacks.

Don't use Rapid Fire with Malediction. It involves too many die rolls. I initially went with fixed damage/increased RoF as the basis for level in order to be different from Innerporation, but level based RoF scales very quickly.

Using increased damage as a basis for level means increasing the size of the teleported object. It is very similar to Innerportation where increased damage represents increase amount of material teleported from the target.

If you want to keep things simple, pick some standard RoF and damage amount and make it an alternate attack for Exoteleport.

I used Limited Use to represent the need for small objects for ammunition. The decision was an arbitrary one. Accessibility or Trigger may be better limitations. The specific limitation is subjective and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Interportation is suitable as an Alternative Attack for Exoteleport (Touch-Only) even Using Abilities at Default despite being a ranged ability and technically lacking Contact Agent and Melee Attack, C. Sometimes rules are meant to be broken.
