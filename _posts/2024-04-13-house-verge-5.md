# House Verge Eugenic Legacy

House Verge was part of an Akashic genetic experiment and still retains its genetic heritage (albeit mixed with Ranathim blood). See [Aristocratic Eugenics](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:aristocratic-houses#toc23) on the Psi-Wars wiki for details.

## Verge Eugenic Power-Up [50]
**Advantages**: Verge Bloodline [1]; Spend 49 points on Classic Appearance (Aristocratic) [1] or on the following packages:

* Verge Beauty [6 or 15]
* Verge Compatibility [7]
* Verge Fortitude [16]
* Verge Cunning [11]
* Ranathim Beauty [6 or 15]
* Ranathim Energy Reserve [6]
* Ranathim Passion [6]

**Disadvantages**: Replace any of your template disadvantages with the following disadvantages  (If you have Bloodline Purity + Ranathim Bloodline 2 or higher, you may choose an additional -5 points worth of the following disadvantages, increasing your disadvantage limit by -5 points!): Chronic Depression [-15*]; Chronic Pain [varies]; Chummy or Gregarious [-5 or -10]; Distinctive Feature (Small Horns, Ranathim Skin Tone, etc.) [-1]; Overconfidence [-5]; Ranathim Passion Disadvantages [varies]

**Features**: Verge Genetic Dominance [0]

## Ranathim Compatibility [1]
Members of House Verge are often highly compatible with Ranathim. Characters with the trait never have complications producing a hybrid with Ranathim and are treated as Ranathim for various psychotronic devices, gain +1 to HT rolls to bond to a Carapace (as if they were Ranathim), etc. Ranathim are more likely to respect their bloodline purity than they would be without the trait.

## Verge Genetic Dominance [0]
Members of House Verge were engineered to draw out latent Psychokinesis from the Ranathim while suppressing Psychic Vampirism. Children born to a Verge and Ranathim parent tend not to have Psychic Vampirism nor the Uncontrollable Appetite.

There are occasionally complications for the hybrid children. On rare occasions, the children are born without Psychic Vampirism but retaining the Uncontrollable Appetite. Such children are typically unstable. On very rare occasions, a child is born with Steal Power instead of any Psychokinetic ability. This is usually seen as a bad omen.

## Ranathim Bloodline [1/level]
House Verge genetics are often supplemented with Ranathim to boost psionic potential. Each level of Ranathim Bloodline reduces a characters maximum Verge Bloodline level by 1 and, unless otherwise specified, counts as a level of Bloodline Purity for purposes of Psionic Legacy prerequisites. 

Each level of Ranathim Bloodline also grants +1 to reactions for anyone who considers a mixed bloodline a useful trait instead of the normal bonus from Bloodline Purity. In general, members of House Verge typically consider these traits as equivalent. The reaction bonus also tends to apply to characters with Preference (Exotic Aliens).

## Maradonian Bloodline Packages
The following packages are from the House Verge's Maradonian bloodline. Due to their mixed heritage, even the most "pure" members of House Verge rarely have more the Bloodline Purity 2. Characters with higher Verge Bloodline Purity than Ranathim Bloodline tend not to have special complications but may on rare occasions have Steal Power.

### Verge Beauty [6 or 15]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline

**Advantages**: Attractive [4]; Bloodline Purity 1 [1]; Extreme Sexual Dimorphism [1]

Verge are naturally attractive, and their Maradonian bloodline's beauty tends to pair well with Ranathim features. Unlike some other Maradonian Houses, House Verge tends to have masculine sons and feminine daughters. In some, this distinction is particularly striking.

Even Verge without this package rarely have androgynous appearance.

For characters with both Verge Beauty and Ranathim Beauty, the package is as follows: Beautiful/Handsome [12]; Bloodline Purity 1 [1]; Extreme Sexual Dimorphism [1]; Ranathim Bloodline 1 [1] for a total of 15 points

### Verge Compatibility [7]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline

**Advantages**: Resistant (+3; Psychic Vampirism) [5]; Ranathim Compatibility [1]; Bloodline Purity 1 [1]

Verge were "designed" to be genetically compatible with Ranathim and suppress certain Ranathim traits in their offspring.

### Verge Fortitude [16]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline

**Advantages**: Very Fit [15]; Bloodline Purity 1 [1]

Verge tend to be healthy and resilient.

### Verge Cunning [11]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline

**Advantages**: Born Tactician 1 [10]

Verge are natural leaders and strategists. It was these skills (and a whole lot of luck) that allowed House Verge to conquer the Astral Spiral with relative ease.

## Ranathim Bloodline Packages
House Verge is of a mixed bloodline with Ranathim traits. Their line was "designed" to draw latent telekinetic power from Ranathim while suppressing their natural psychic vampirism. Verge with a higher level of Ranathim Bloodline than Verge Bloodline Purity may have complications from partially suppressed traits. The GM need not enforce this on PCs, but it is something to think about when designing characters.

These packages are examples of hybrid traits and are not exhaustive. Feel free to design your own if you feel inclined, but note that they are tailored for House Verge genetics and may need adjustments for non Verge bloodlines.

### Ranathim Beauty [6 or 15]
As Verge Beauty except replace Verge Bloodline Purity 1 [1] with Ranathim Bloodline 1 [1].

### Ranathim Energy Reserve [6]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline

**Advantages**: [Ranathim Energy Reserve](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ranathim#toc6) 6 [9]; Social Vampire [1]; Ranathim Bloodline 1 [1]

**Disadvantages**: Chummy [-5]

**Note**: Social Vampire always and only applies to the Ranathim Energy Reserve.

Some Verge inherit a special psionic energy reserve from their Ranathim ancestors. They lack the ability to feed it by stealing it but are instead able to feed from the energy of crowds. As a result of their inherited hunger, they are uncomfortable when alone.

### Ranathim Passion [6]
**Prerequisites**: Verge Bloodline; at least -5 points in [passion disadvantages](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ranathim#toc8)

**Advantages**: [Godlike Extra-Effort](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ranathim#toc4)(Limited, Passion, -20%)[4]; Passionate Psi [1]; Ranathim Bloodline 1 [1]

Some Verge are able to draw both psionic strength from their passions. They can also put extreme effort into their physical abilities like their Ranathim ancestors but only when the Passionate Psi bonus would apply.

## Psionic and Otherwise Supernatural Legacy
Psionic Power Ups are for another post. House Verge's psionic abilities are telekinetic in nature and without the aero/cryo/pyrokinesis of House Mistral and its cadets. Note that each level of Ranathim Bloodline counts as a level of Verge Bloodline Purity for meeting prerequisites.

Verge sorcery details is also for a separate post. House Verge attempts to blend Akashic mysticism with Lithian sorcery. It is a neat combination, but I need to work out the details.

One obvious question is: "How does House Verge interact with the [Mithna Edict](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/mithanna#toc0)?" The simple answer is that political unions make sense and that not all Ranathim under the Mithna Edict understand their situation. A member of House Verge under the effects of the Mithna Edict is perfectly plausible. I am also considering how House Verge would attempt to combine Akashic destiny manipulation and Lithian sorcery in an attempt to replicate the Mithna Edict in some fashion. I am not sure about the details, but I am currently considering a Destiny based build.

# Other Notes
## Wandering Verge
Verge lack the fertility problems that plague many of the other Maradonian Houses, and there can only be so many heirs. What do non-heir Verge do? They can certainly integrate into society or fight for power. I think it would be neat if some experience wander lust and decide to leave the Astral Spiral and experience the wider Umbral Rim (or even beyond). It is a good opportunity to spread rumors of Maradonian aliens and is an easy option for player characters.

## Slavery
Verge do not have lofty ideals like Elegans and have not forcefully abolished slavery in the Astral Spiral. They may have attempted long ago, but their attempt failed. As a rule, they don't practice slavery themselves considering the institution to be unproductive and backwards, but they tolerate it. Visitors from outside the Spiral bring additional complications when they bring their slaves, and House Verge does not consider angering foreign dignitaries and warlords prudent.

Slavery is regulated in the Astral Spiral. There are proper procedures for registration and standards of treatment. Sadly, the standards are not always followed properly, and the populace does not seem willing end the institution. The situation is a mess, but Verge at least makes an effort to keep their people civilized.

## Belters of the Hyperspace Graveyard
I am considering merging the Hyperspace Graveyard and the unnamed belt. I wanted some belter population because I thought that Lithian belters would be a neat combination. Both the belt and the graveyard would share elements such as pirates, scavengers, spacers, etc., so I figured combining them made sense. The graveyard is not the entirety of the belt, but it is a prominent location.
