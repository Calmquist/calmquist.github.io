I wondered how point costs change with Multiplicative Modifiers (Powers p. 102), so I decided to calculate the costs for the abilities in Psionic Powers. Here are my findings.

I think my calculations are correct, but I may have some errors (especially for Innate Attack with partial dice). I rounded costs except for openly leveled abilities.

Note that I made no changes to the modifiers and have not repriced any of the techniques.

# Anti-Psi
Cancellation, Interruption, Psionic Overload, Psionic Shield costs have no change.

## Para-Invisibility
**Additive:** 5/level

**Multiplicative:** 4/level

## Psychic Armor
**Additive:** 8/level

**Multiplicative:** 7.2/level

## Screaming
**Additive:** 9 for level 1; 15/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 9 for level 1; 4.5/additional level

## True Sight
**Additive:** 16/21

**Multiplicative:** 13/20

## Notes
These costs are mostly the same or slightly lower with Multiplicative Modifiers, but Screaming is significantly less expensive for obvious reasons.

# Astral Projection
Astral Armor, Astral Celerity, Astral Sight  costs have no change.

## Astral Sword
**Additive:** 8 for level 1; 6/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 3.725 for level 1; 2.345/additional level

## Astral Travel
**Additive:** 28/36/48/56/68/80

**Multiplicative:** 36/36/36/36/36/54

## Notes
Most of the abilities have identical costs since they don't have any enhancements. I am not sure if I calculated Astral Sword correctly. Astral Travel's cost schedule doesn't work well because of the -80% cap.

# Ergokinesis
## Cyberpsi
Data Retrieval, I/O Tap and Remote Control costs do not change.

### Netrunning
**Additive:** 20/30/40/50/75/90/100 + 7/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 32/32/32/32/32/48/64 + 7/additional level

### Notes
Netrunning suffers from the same problem as Astral Travel.

## Electrokinesis
Dampen and Electric Vision costs do not change.

### Confuse
**Additive:** 15/18/21/26 + 26/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 6/13/20/24.3 + 24.3/additional level

### EK Shield
**Additive:** 4/level

**Multiplicative:** 3.6/level

### Lightning
**Additive:** 12/level

**Multiplicative:** 8.4/level

### Radar Sense
**Additive:** 12 + 2/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 11/14/16/17.6 + 1.6/additional level

### Surge
**Additive:** 11/level

**Multiplicative:** 12.4/level

### Notes
These prices are close, and the cost schedules all work. Surge costs more due to the -80% limitation limit.

## Photokinesis
### Flash
**Additive:** 22 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 6.3 + 1/additional level

### Hologram
**Additive:** 10/13/15/18/20/23/25/28/30/33

**Multiplicative:** 7/7/7/11/12/12/13/14/15/15

### Photorefraction
**Additive:** 5/level; 4/level for blocking variant

**Multiplicative:** 4.32/level; 3.52/level for blocking variant

### Notes
These abilities translate fairly well. Photorefraction is slightly cheaper while Flash is significantly cheaper. Hologram suffers from the -80% limitation restriction problem and a slow cost progression.

# ESP
## Divination
Combat Sense and Visions costs do not change. Why doesn't Danger Sense get the PM?

### Prognostication
**Additive:** 18/23/28/33/38/43/48/53/58/63/68/73/78

**Multiplicative:** 11/12/14/15/17/18/20/21/23/24/26/27/29

### Retrocognition
**Additive:** 14/20/30/40

**Multiplicative:** 14/19/26/33

### Retrocognitive Flashbacks
**Additive:** 10/16/26/36

**Multiplicative:** 8/9/12/15

### Signature Sniffer
**Additive:** 4/9/18/28

**Multiplicative:** 4/9/18/27

### Notes
Signature Sniffer has a similar cost, and the other abilities are fairly close at low levels, but high levels tend to cost much less with Multiplicative Modifiers.

## Remote Senses
### Awareness
**Additive:** 9 + 2/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 9/11/13/15/17 + 1.7/additional level

### Clairaudience
**Additive:** 13 + 5/additional level; 5 points with Clairvoyance

**Multiplicative:** 13/18/23/27.5 + 2.75/level; 5 points with Clairvoyance + 0.5/level beyond 4

### Clairvoyance
**Additive:** 13 + 5/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 13/18/23/27.5 + 2.75/level

### Notes
These costs are similar. Multiplicative Modifiers make purchasing Clairaudience with Clairvoyance inconvenient.

## Other Abilities
Seeker Sense cost may or may not change. The individual Detect abilities may cost a little less.

### Psi Sense
**Additive:** 8/13/22/32

**Multiplicative:** 6/13/21/30

### Psidar
**Additive:** 9/14/19/29

**Multiplicative:** 6/14/18/27

### Psychic Hunches
**Additive:** 14/29/36/51

**Multiplicative:** 14/27/25/49

### Spirit Communication
**Additive:** 8/13/18/28

**Multiplicative:** 8/12/16/24

### True Sight
**Additive:** 15/19

**Multiplicative:** 11/17

### Notes
These prices are slightly lower but still close wiht Multiplicative Modifiers.

# Probability Alteration
Combat Sense is the same as the Divination version. Adjustment and Second Chance costs do not change.

## Coincidence
**Additive:** 27/level

**Multiplicative:** 24/level


## Curse
**Additive:** 22/24/26/28/30/32/34/36/38

**Multiplicative:** 7/7/8/10/12/12/13/13/14

## Weather Control
**Additive:** 22/level

**Multiplicative:** 24/level

## Notes
Weather control is slightly more expensive due to the -80% limitation cap. Curse costs significantly less. Adjustment simply happens to cost the same due to rounding.

# Psychic Healing
## Aura Reading
**Additive:** 4/7/13/16/22

**Multiplicative:** 8/8/8/8/8

## Cure
**Additive:** 18 + 6/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 18 + 3.6/additional level

## Cure Disease
**Additive:** 6/level

**Multiplicative:** 6 + 1.2/level

## Cure Injury
**Additive:** 12 + 6/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 12 + 2.4/additional level

## Disease Shield
**Additive:** 15/17/19/21/23/25/27/29

**Multiplicative:** 7/8/8/9/9/10/11/11

## Life Extension
**Additive:** 9 + 12/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 9 + 7.2/additional level

## Sleep
**Additive:** 25/28/31/36 + 36/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 8/18/29/34 * 34/additional level

## Notes
Aura Reading's cost is entirely flat. Low levels of Sleep are inexpensive, but the cost rises as the limitations are removed. The others are close but slightly less expensive.

# Psychic Vampirism

## Drain (Attribute)
**Additive:** 24/26/28/30/32/34/36/38/40

**Multiplicative:** 18/19/20/22/23/25/27/28/30

## Drain Emotion
**Additive:** 10/15/25/30

**Multiplicative:** 17/17/17/17

## Steal Dreams
**Additive:** 23/31/40/48/67

**Multiplicative:** 12/17/30/35/47

## Steal Energy
**Additive:** 32/34/37/39/42/44 + 7/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 14/14/14/14/14/14 + 1.92/additional level

## Steal Life
**Additive:** 25 + 4/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 18 + 2.79/additional level

## Steal Power
**Additive:** 55/65/75/85/95/105/115/125/135

**Multiplicative:** 20/20/20/25/30/33/36/39/42

## Notes
Drain Emotion and Steal Energy are basically flat with Multiplicative Modifiers. Steal Power is much more affordable.

# Psychokinesis
## Telekinesis
### TK Bullet
**Additive:** 5/level

**Multiplicative:** 4.48/level

### TK Crush
**Additive:** 5/level

**Multiplicative:** 3.665625/level

### TK Grab
**Additive:** 7/level; 4/level (Short Ranged)

**Multiplicative:** 4.75/level; 3.25/level (Short Ranged)

### Levitation
**Additive:** 14 + 2/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 14 + 1.98/level

## Other Abilities
### Cryokinesis
**Additive:** 13/level

**Multiplicative:** 0.81/level + 0.69/level + 7.7625/level (however you want to round that)

Note that Temperature Control is worth less than the Fatigue Attack when using Multiplicative Multipliers.

### PK Shield
**Additive:** 4/level

**Multiplicative:** 3.6/level

### Pyrokinesis
**Additive:** 14/level

**Multiplicative:** 0.81/level + 7.7625/level + 1.5525/level (however you want to round that)

Note that Temperature Control is worth less than the attacks when using Multiplicative Multipliers.

### Notes
PK Shield was close. Recomputing the other abilities was a bit of work. This demonstrates the fact that converting abilities that make use of Alternative Abilities may require swapping some abilities.

# Telepathy
## Communication
The costs for Borrow Skill, Emotion Sense and  do not change.

### Telereceive
**Additive:** 21/36/42/45/60/75; 9/18/24/27/42/57 (Shallow)

**Multiplicative:** 21/36/42/45/55/68 ; 9/18/24/27/41/54 (Shallow)

### Telesend
**Additive:** 9/18/21/24/27/42

**Multiplicative:** 9/18/21/24/27/41

### Telespeak
**Additive:** 18/30/39/45/63/93

**Multiplicative:** 17/27/38/44/54/76

### Notes
The costs are mostly identical. There are really only differences when enhancements and limitations overlap.

## Control

### Aspect
**Additive:** 4/level

**Multiplicative:** 3.4375/level

### Emotion Control
**Additive:** 10/15/25/30/55/80; 5 points with Suggestion

**Multiplicative:** 12/12/24/30/43/55

### Telecontrol
**Additive:** 30/45/60/75/90

**Multiplicative:** 30/30/30/38/60

### Notes
Sensory Control (Overload) and Telecontrol have the early flat cost progression. Emotion Control is more expensive with Suggestion, but it still less that with Additive Multipliers except at low levels.

## Offense
### Instill Fear
**Additive:** 18 + 3/additional level

**Multiplicative:** 18/21/24/27 + 2.7/additional level

### Mental Blow

**Multiplicative:** 8/15/22/27/31/36

### Mental Stab
**Additive:** 33/43/52/69/85/101

**Multiplicative:** 27/27/44/58/71/85

### Sleep
Same as the Psychic Healing version.

### Notes
Costs are fairly similar except that Mental Stab is quite a bit less expensive.

## Sense and Defense

### Mind Clouding
**Additive:** 6/level

**Multiplicative:** 2.75/level +  2.8875/level

### Mind Shield
**Additive:** 4/level; 3/level (Feedback)

# Teleportation

## Autoteleport
**Additive:** 20/30/40/50/55/60/65/70/75/80/85/90/95/100

**Multiplicative:** 32/32/32/32/32/32/32/32/32/32/40/48/56/64

## Combat Teleport
**Additive:** 40; 15 with Autoteleport

**Multiplicative:** 33; varies between 5 and 8 with Autoteleport

The "custom limitation" should be a limitation for Reliable or Blink.

## Exoteleport
**Additive:** 46 + 5/additional level; 35 + 5/additional level (Touch-Only)

**Multiplicative:** 52 for levels 1-6 + 0.9/additional level; 16 for levels 1-6 + 0.3/additional level (Touch-Only)

## RL Exoteleport
**Additive:** 45/55/65/75/80/85/90/95/100/105/110/115/120/125; 34/44/54/64 + 5/additional level (Touch-Only)

**Multiplicative:** 46 for levels 1-8 + 6/additional level; 10.4 for levels 1-8 + 1.2/additional level

## Innerportation
**Additive:** 9/level
**Multiplicative:** 8.352/level

## Portersense
**Additive:** 4/7/11/16

**Multiplicative:** 3/7/11/15

## Notes
Both Auto/ExoTeleport have several levels of equal cost. Both start a little more costly but quickly become much less expensive. As expected, the Touch-Only version are much cheaper. Innerportation and Portersense have nearly identical costs. Combat Teleport has an inconvenient pricing scheme when combined with Autoteleport but is always less expensive with Multiplicative Modifiers.

# Additional Powers
## Animal Telepathy
### Animal Speech
**Additive:** 15/18/20/25/30/35/40/45/50

**Multiplicative:** 15/18/20/24/28/32/36/40

### Beast Control
**Additive:** 10/18/23/48/73

**Multiplicative:** 10/10/13/19/25

## Biokinesis
### Mold Flesh
**Additive:** 32/34/36/38/40/42/44/46

**Multiplicative:** 8 + 0.4/additional level

### Reshape Dream
**Additive:** 7/14/18/25

**Multiplicative:** 10/10/10/10

## Psychometabolism
The costs does not change.

## Notes
The Psychometabolism abilities don't have enhancements, so their costs don't change. Dream Control has an initial flat cost schedule, and Reshape Dream is entirely flat. Mold Flesh much cheaper and is almost completely flat.

# Final Thoughts
I won't say that Multiplicative Modifiers are superior to Additive Modifiers in all cases, but they may produce better results for abilities that have large enhancement modifiers. -80% in limitations is often crippling even with large enhancements. The main drawback is that using Multiplicative Modifiers requires recomputing cost of most pre published abilities and may even necessitate redesigning abilities. The -80% cap encourages Limited Enhancements (B111) which makes for more complex builds but may also allow for additional interesting options.

I may do something similar for Sorcery and Divine Favor at some point. I totally haven't done the work already.
