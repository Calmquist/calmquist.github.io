Psionic powers can have abilities that do basically the same things in slightly different ways. Today's post converts some Photokinesis abilities to Umbrakinesis.

# Umbral Fantasm
Here are some new techniques for Umbral Fantasm.

## Tactile Shadows
**Hard**

_Default:_ Umbral Fantasm-2; cannot exceed Umbral Fantasm.

You can make your illusion feel real. It still can't affect the physical world (but see Physical Fantasm).

## Physical Fantasm
**Hard**

_Default:_ Umbral Fantasm-4; cannot exceed Umbral Fantasm.

If you know the Shadow Hands ability, you can use Link it to your fantasm. This allows your fantasm to affect the world as if through a pair of shadowy hands. This gives your +4 in the Quick Contest to pass your illusion as real.

# Shadow Hands
**3.25/level**; **2.275/level** with Multiplicative Modifiers

_Skill:_ Shadow Hands (IQ/Hard)

You can create a pair of shadowy hands that can move objects at a distance. They have a ST and Move (modified by encumbrance) equal to your Shadow Hands level. You can use the hands to grab objects, strike, grapple, throw objects, etc. but you cannot affect yourself directly. This ability works like the short ranged variant of TK Grab (Psionic Powers p. 54), but your shadowy hands are visible. You may use this ability only in an area with nearby shadows.

_Statistics:_ Telepathy (Based on IQ, +20%; Cannot Affect Self, -20%; Environmental, Shadows, -5%; Increased Range, x2, +10%; Necrokinesis, -10%; Requires IQ Roll, -10%; Visible, -20%) [3.25/level]

## Mass Grab
This is identical to the TK Grab technique (Psionic Powers p. 55).

## Split Focus
_Default:_ Shadow Hands-8; cannot exceed Shadow Hands.

_Prerequisite:_ Shadow Hands at level 8 or higher; 10 or higher with Multiplicative Modifiers

This works like the TK Grab technique (Pyramid 3/97 p. 10) but note the prerequisite.

## Shadow Body
This is identical to the Tactile Telekinesis TK Grab technique (Pyramid 3/97 p. 11) with the added effect of covering your body with visible shadows making it obvious that _something_ is happening.

# Strike Blind
**/level**; **/level** with Multiplicative Modifiers

_Skill:_ Strike Blind (Will/Hard)

You can blind a target. Roll a Quick Contest of skill vs. the subject's Will; Mind Shield protects normally. If he loses, he is Blinded (B124) for minutes equal to his margin of failure.

At level 1, this requires skin-to-skin contact. At level 2, it requires a touch. At level 3, it can be used at range at -1/yard to skill. At level 4, apply normal range penalties (B550). Your target resists at -1/level after 4.

_Statistics:_

## Mental Blindness
_Default:_ Strike Blind -3; cannot exceed Strike Blind

If you blind your target successfully with this technique, you also "blind" his memory. When the effect ends, he will have no memory of the events when he was blinded or even that he was blinded. Contextual clues may reveal that _something_ transpired and that he may be missing memories, and he may recover the lost memories with certain psychic treatment, Hypnosis, Psychology, etc.


# Designer Notes
The Umbral Fantasm techniques are obvious and shouldn't require any special explanation.

Split Focus and Shadow Body are tricky, but they explained in the Pyramid article.

Mental Blindness is a Total Amnesia variant.
