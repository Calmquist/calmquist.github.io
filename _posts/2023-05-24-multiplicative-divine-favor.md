And now for part 3. I don.'t have any plans for a part 4

# Minor Blessings
## Final Rest
No change

## Holy Touch
No change

## Confidence
No change

## Powerful Conviction
No change

## Protection from Evil
No change

## Feed the Masses
**Additive Cost:** 18; Learned: 4

**Multiplicative Cost:** 14; Learned: 3

## Fireproof
**Additive Cost:** 18; Learned 4

**Multiplicative Cost:** 15; Learned: 3

## Flesh Wounds
No change

## Sermonize
No change

## Divine Guidance
**Additive Cost:** 25; Learned: 5

**Multiplicative Cost:** 15; Learned: 3

Divine Favor doesn't seem to use the Psionic Powers version of computing cost for Innate Attack with partial dice. I went with the Divine Favor version here since it was easy to fix when I discovered the discrepancy.

## Ghost Shirt
No change

## Spirit Weapon
**Additive Cost:** 24; Learned: 5

**Multiplicative Cost:** 19; Learned: 4

## Stoicism
No change

## Notes
Most of these miracles have unchanged costs, and the ones that are changed are only reduced slightly.

# Major Blessings
## Traveler's Blessing
**Additive Cost:** 26; Learned 6

**Multiplicative Cost:** 21; Learned 5

## Walk on the Water
**Additive Cost:** 29; Learned: 6

**Multiplicative Cost:** 27; Learned: 6

## Protection from Evil (Enhanced)
No change

## Sense True Evil
**Additive Cost:** 33; Learned: 7

**Multiplicative Cost:** 28; Learned: 6

## Lay on Hands
**Additive Cost:** 39; Learned: 8

**Multiplicative Cost:** 14; Learned: 3

## Fireproof (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 43; Learned: 9

**Multiplicative Cost:** 38; Learned: 8

## Holy Glory
**Additive Cost:** 42; Learned: 9

**Multiplicative Cost:** 41; Learned: 9

## Smite 
**Additive Cost:** 45; Learned: 9

**Multiplicative Cost:** 22; Learned: 5

## Consecrate Ground
**Additive Cost:** 50; Learned: 10

**Multiplicative Cost:** 18; Learned: 4

## Feed the Masses (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 54; Learned: 11

**Multiplicative Cost:** 42; Learned: 9

## See Evil
**Additive Cost:** 51; Learned: 11

**Multiplicative Cost:** 42; Learned: 9

## Notes
Most of the miracles cost fewer points but typically not by much. The Learned Prayer cost rarely changes by more than a point. lay on Hands, Smite and Consecrate Ground are exceptions since they have significant enhancements and limitations.

# Miraculous Power
## Walk on the Water (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 65; Learned: 13

**Multiplicative Cost:** 60; Learned: 12

## Rainmaker
**Additive Cost:** 70; Learned: 14

**Multiplicative Cost:** 40; Learned: 8

## Raise Dead
**Additive Cost:** 58; Learned: 12

**Multiplicative Cost:** 17; Learned: 4

## Golem
**Additive Cost:** 76; Learned: 16 

**Multiplicative Cost:** 72; Learned: 15

## Smite (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 83; Learned: 17

**Multiplicative Cost:** 19; Learned 4

## Consecrate Ground (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 90; Learned: 18

**Multiplicative Cost:** 30; Learned: 6

## Holy Glory (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 98; Learned: 20

**Multiplicative Cost:** 95; Learned: 19

## Lay on Hands (Enhanced)
**Additive Cost:** 107; Learned: 22

**Multiplicative Cost:** 66; Learned: 14

## Notes
Rainmaker, Smite (Enhanced), Consecrate Ground and Lay on Hands cost significantly less. Raise Dead may be too inexpensive. The others are close.

# World Shaking Miracles
## Eclipse
**Additive Cost:** 129; Learned: 26

**Multiplicative Cost:** 101; Learned: 21

## Plague of Insects
**Additive Cost:** 147; Learned: 30

**Multiplicative Cost:** 121; Learned: 25

## Part the Sea
**Additive Cost:** 158; Learned: 32

**Multiplicative Cost:** 150; Learned: 30

## Resurrection
**Additive Cost:** 228; Learned: 68

**Multiplicative Cost:** 59; Learned: 12

## Notes
These aren't too bad. Eclipse becomes a Miraculous Power category miracle. Part the Sea barely gets any discount due to the -80% cap. As with Raise Dead, Resurrection may be too easy.

# Multiplicative Divine Favor
Divine Favor is its own advantage, but what if it were designed using Multiplicative Modifiers? Below is a table with the cost for each level. See the Under the Hood box on Powers: Divine Favor p. 4 to see how this was done.

| Level | Multiplicative Cost | Multiplicative Cost Raw |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 4     | 10                  |                         |
| 5     | 15                  |                         |
| 6     | 20                  | 19                      |
| 7     | 25                  |                         |
| 8     | 30                  |                         |
| 9     | 40                  | 38                      |
| 10    | 50                  |                         |
| 11    | 60                  |                         |
| 12    | 75                  | 75                      |
| 13    | 85                  |                         |
| 14    | 100                 |                         |
| 15    | 115                 | 113                     |
| 16    | 130                 |                         |

There are a few ways to extrapolate/interpolate the cost from the "raw" cost computed using Multiplicative Modifiers. The table above looks fairly decent. Levels 11-13 are a bit funny, but fixing them would make some other levels "off."

In order to make use of these values, one would need to recalculate the "learned prerequisite" for many of the miracles.

# Final Thoughts
These calculations were quite simple. The most difficult part was determining the base cost of abilities based advantages such as Control and Detect. Some of these abilities definitely need to be modified in order to fit the "correct" categories since many of them are both highly enhanced and limited. If you are playing a game with different assumptions about what constitutes a blatant miracle or that accepts visible miracles as normal, you may be able to accept the cost differences without much trouble. Do keep an eye on Raise Dead and Resurrection. They are too easy except for games where resurrection is supposed to be relatively easy.
