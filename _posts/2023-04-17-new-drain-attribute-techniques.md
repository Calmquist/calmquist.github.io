I have been making low effort Telepathy/Ergokinesis abilities for a while, so I decided to do something different. Today's post contains some new low effort techniques for Drain (Attribute).

# Drain (Attribute)
GURPS Psionic Powers suggests buying different attributes as alternative abilities (p. 50). This does save points. What if, instead, you wanted to drain multiple attributes at once? In that case, use the following technique.

## Drain (Additional Attribute)
**Hard**

__Default:__ Drain (Attribute)-3; cannot exceed Drain (Attribute)

You can drain an additional attribute. Use a single Quick Contest and a single duration. You drain both attributes at once. Purchase this technique separately for each skill and other attribute combination. 

## Irritating/Incapacitating Drain
**Hard**

__Default:__ Varies; cannot exceed Drain (Attribute)

Psionic Powers has Painful Draining, but other irritating/incapacitating conditions are possible. Some examples are listed below with their defaults:

* Tipsy: Drain (Attribute)-1
* Nauseated: Drain (Attribute)-3
* Euphoria: Drain (Attribute)-3
* Severe Pain: Drain (Attribute)-4
* Daze: Drain (Attribute)-5

Many of the Incapacitating conditions may have too high a penalty, so make those secondary conditions:

* Agony: Drain (Attribute)-2
* Ecstasy: Drain (Attribute)-2
* Unconsciousness: Drain (Attribute)-4
* Heart Attack: Drain (Attribute)-6

These lists are merely a few examples. Each condition is a separate technique. Alternatively, combine primary irritating and secondary incapacitating condition into single techniques.

# Designer Notes
There isn't much to note about the design. These techniques are all obvious. GMs may want to keep an eye on Drain (Additional Attribute).

The material presented here is my original creation, intended for use with the [GURPS](https://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) system from [Steve Jackson Games](https://www.sjgames.com/). This material is not official and is not endorsed by Steve Jackson Games.
