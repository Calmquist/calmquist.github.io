Today's post contains some more details about House Verge. Most of today's details will follow either directly or fairly closely from the main premises of the House without delving too deeply into their implications. They are also subject to change if they are found to conflict with other, more logical or simply more interesting details developed later. This post will also not contain many concrete, mechanical details.

See [part 1](https://calmquist.github.io/2023/09/23/house-verge-1.html) for a broad overview of House Verge.

# Eugenic Legacy
Maradonian Houses were bred with specific traits to aid the Akashic Order in its goals (it is really more of a symbiotic relationship, but House Verge was a minor House). House Verge will naturally have a eugenic legacy. As a minor house, I expect its Bloodline Purity to be particularly high in general.

## Psionic Legacy
A few details about House Verge's psionic legacy are obvious from the premises. Verge clearly has Psychokinesis as its power and TK-Grab as an important ability. TK Tether is an obvious BP 0 perk. TK-Grab is fundamental enough to the concept for a BP 1 ability.

[TK Jump](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psychokinesis#toc9) may or may not be a common ability. [TK Hand](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psychokinesis#toc8) certainly could be. [Tactile TK](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psychokinesis#toc6) is definitely a possibility (especially if Verge doesn't get the Ranathim's [Godlike Extra-Effort](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ranathim#toc4) option). Specific abilities and BP levels are open for debate. I would prefer not to have too much overlap with Houses Mistral and [Alacapa](http://worldsbeyondearth.blogspot.com/2023/09/highlun-psi-wars-planet.html), but some is fine. After all, House Verge got stuck in the Umbral Rim for 1000 years.

House Verge explicitly does not _normally_ get Psychic Vamprism from Ranathim genetics due to the standard pseudo-scientific Akashic eugenic handwaving.

## Genetic Legacy
Unlike Houses [Kain](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:house-kain), Mistral and [Sabine](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:house-sabine), House Verge's men are particularly masculine and women are particularly feminine in appearance. Androgynous appearance is discouraged, and Extreme Sexual Dimorphism is either a general optional trait or part of a genetic package. They are typically at least part Ranathim after all.

One of their genetic packages includes Appearance of at least Attractive level. Other traits aren't so obvious. Something related to their ability to integrate into Lithian society or cause them to ~~dig too deep into the Mines of Moria~~ venture too far into the [Umbral Rim](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:umbral-rim) may be appropriate.

### Ranathim Legacy
House Verge "interacts with Satemo" and is "genetically compatible with Ranathim," so it make sense to give them some Ranathim traits. One way to do this is to create custom "hybrid" racial templates. Another options is to create common genetic packages with Ranathim traits. A benefit to the latter option is that it keeps House Verge mechanically similar to other Maradonian Houses. It also allows "hybrid" characters in a game where "hybrids" are normally disallowed - House Verge would be an exception in that case.

# Verge Tools
Maradonian Houses tend to have other special abilities such as martial arts techniques, special gear and unique abilities.

## Special Gear
Before addressing what special gear House Verge has, it is important to know that it was relatively unimportant until it conquered a region of the Umbral Rim. Verge has also been separated from the other Houses for 1000 years. Some things it likely does not have include:

* Telekinetic [Valkyrie](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/valkyrie-pattern-fighter) variant
  * It was likely too unimportant to have one
  * It knew about them and _might_ have some local Lithian ship with special (Lithian or Lithian/Maradonian fusion) psychotronics
* Special Maradonian super armor
  * There may be some but it is rare (and doesn't fit the typical Lithian aesthetic)
  * It _may_ have some [Flesh Carapace](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:ferthe-dapolor), but that is also rare
* Robots
  * It isn't very Lithian, but it may make an interesting contrast
* Force swords
  * House Verge doesn't not have them but tends to prefer psi swords
* ARC
  * It is _possible_ that House Verge is an industrial powerhouse in its section of the Umbral Rim, but it can't compete with the Alliance and certainly not with the Empire

House Verge likely does have some interesting gear including:

* Psi sword (and psi sabers)
  * "Force swords are for the [psionically] weak"
* Lithian drugs
  * They may have special effects due to House Verge's special genetic nature
* Psychotronics
  * Their psychotronics are likely more Lithian than Maradonian, but they may have some interesting "fusion" psychotronics

## Martial Arts
House Verge has access to the Maradonian force sword styles and could theoretically teach all of them. Some styles deserve special attention:

* The [Destructive Form](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:destructive-form) is useful as a Maradonian counter to the [Fell Form](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:sefelka-sonostra) with its unarmed combat
  * Its focus on beats may also fit well with Tactile TK or Ranathim Godlike Extra-Effort 
* The [Graceful Form](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:graceful-form) has good synergy with its emphasis on Flying Leap
* The [Guardian's Form's](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:knightly-force-swordsmanship) emphasis on the force shield makes it useful in a lightly armored Lithian society
  * Psionic ST bonus may also help with beats and slams
* The [Swift Form](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:swift-form) _may_ be applicable as "noble dueling style" used agains other Lithian nobility
  * Also, psi sabers seem to be a cool way to have a Maradonian/Lithian fusion weapon

In addition to the Maradonian styles, House Verge teaches [Psionic Force Swordsmanship](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psionic-force-swordsmanship) with the [Resonance Omen](http://psi-wars.wikidot.com/wiki:psionic-force-swordsmanship#toc16) moveset. I am not sure how well this works mechanically, but it definitely fits thematically. Psionic Force Swordsmanship is a complicated style. I don't expect the Fell Form to be commonly learned in House Verge, but I expect them to be aware of its existance.

Regardless of style, House Verge teaches Thrown Weapon (Force Sword) and Return Strike (Thrown Weapon (Force Sword)) as special options. Members of House Verge may also learn Weapon Adaptation (Short Sword to Force Sword) or (Small Sword to Force Saber) in order to use their force sword styles with Lithian neurolash batons or neurolash blades. Alternatively, they _could_ learn the Lithian dueling styles and adapt the style to work with a force sword/saber.

I don't see any special considerations for blaster arts.

# Other Things
I will leave things like culture, religion and destiny for a future post. They require a good deal of history and understanding of Lithian and Maradonian cultures to get "right."

I will not give special consideration to the Mithna Edict. House Verge is already complex enough that it doesn't really need it, and I highly doubt that an Akashic eugenics program has the knowledge or power to alter Ozamanthim's oaths.
