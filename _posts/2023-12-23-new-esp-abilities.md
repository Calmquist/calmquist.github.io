It was pointed out to me that I had not created any new ESP abilities, so I decided to rectify that issue. This is the last new psionic ability post of the year.

# Precognitive Alteration
**8 points/level**

_Skill:_ Precognitive Alteration (IQ/Hard)

This ability is identical to Timeline Alteration (Pyramid 4/3, p. 27) except as an ESP ability and without the Backlash and the restriction on involving help from others. Instead of altering the timeline, you foresaw the event and made the necessary alterations in advance.

# Speed of Thought

This is identical to the Chronokinesis version (Pyramid 4/3, p. 25).

# Para-Radar
**18 points for Level 1 +4 points/additional level**

_Skill:_ Awareness (Per/Hard)

This is a variant of the Awareness ability based on Para-Radar (B81) instead of Extra-Sensory Awareness. To determine the range, find the range for the Awareness ability and multiply it by 10.

Your range may be better than with the Awareness ability, and you can see through thin fabric and vegetation (gaining +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons), but your senses are not as detailed. You must make a separate Awareness roll to distinguish fine relief).

An even lower resolution version is possible. Treat this as Para-Radar based on normal Radar instead of Imaging Radar (B81). This is a separate ability and has 100 times the range but can only provide a general size and shape.

This ability may be taken as an alternative to the Awareness ability. Alternatively, the following techniques may be available:

## Fine Relief
**Hard**

__Default:__ Awareness-4; cannot exceed Awareness.

You can see fine details as if you had the Awareness ability of the same level as your Para-Radar ability. You lose the ability to sense through light concealment, and your range is divided by 10.

This technique can only be used with the Para-Radar ability.

If used with the low resolution variant, it instead increases the resolution to that of the "normal" Para-Radar ability. Each type of use is a separate technique.

## Increase Wavelength
**Hard**

__Default:__ Awareness-4 or Awareness-8; see below; cannot exceed Awareness.

You "increase the wavelength" of your psionic sense. This increases the range of your sense at the cost of reducing your resolution.

Switching from Awareness to Para-Radar is at a -8 penalty and allows you to sense as if you had Para-Radar at half your Awareness level.

Switching from Para-Radar to the "low resolution" variant is at a -4 penalty.

Each use is a separate technique.

# Designer Notes
ESP is fairly well covered already. I have a few other ideas, but I want to combine them with Psychometabolism variants in a separate post.

These abilities are fairly straightforward. Precognitive Alteration and Speed of Thought are straight out of Chronokinesis (with some minor modification in the case of Precognitive Alteration).

The Para-Radar ability is also obvious. The new techniques are simply Abilities at Default, and the "low resolution" variant of Para-Radar is an obvious extension of Para-Radar.
