# Rapid Fire with a Single Target
A Set of Weapons and Armor for Fudge has some vague suggestions for Simulating Autofire in Fudge for single targets:
* For each point of relative degree of success on the attack, 1/10 of the shots hit
* The number of shots that hit is equal to the relative degree of success
  * It suggests not adding relative degree to damage in this specific case but not the previous one for some reason
* Simply increase ODF
* Roll for each hit with -1 to hit for each additional shot
* Give a bonus to hit
  * It suggests +2
  * It suggests adding relative degree to damage in this case
  
I do not like the idea of rolling for each shot. That is too many rolls. The suggestion to increase ODF is vague and has no recommendation on how much to increase ODF. Since it increases ODF, it would also mean increased armor penetration which may or may not make sense. The bonus to hit makes sense since there are multiple shots. It is also similar to GURPS rapid fire bonus. Using relative degree to determine how many shots hit is also similar to the way GURPS handles it and does not require additional rolls.

Due to Psi-Wars "action" style, I think the following could work fairly well:
* Add +2 to hit (possibly +1 for some mid rate rapid fire)
* A number of shots hit equal to the smaller of the relative margin and the maximum number of shots
* If the maximum number of shots <= the relative margin, the last shot that hits is a graze

## Example
Zen Grimshaw is a Great (+2) shot with his Shoto and is attempting to shoot his treacherous rival, Haro Daijin. They are at a distance but within pistol range, so Zen needs a minimum of Fair to hit, and Haro can attempt to dodge. Haro is also a Great shot, but he has a semi-automatic Imperial Combine blaster pistol (along with backup on the way).

Zen shoots with a poor roll of -1. He gets +2 for his automatic blaster for a Superb shot. Haro make a Good dodge, so Zen's relative degree of success is +2 for two hits. The first is a direct hit while the second is a graze.

Haro also shoots at Zen and rolls a +1. His blaster is semi automatic and gets no bonus, but he still makes a Great shot. Zen attempts to dodge, but it is merely Mediocre. This gives Haro a +4 relative margin. Assuming Haro's blaster has a maximum of 3 shots at once, all the shots hit Zen, and none are mere grazes. Hopefully Zen's EK Shield holds.

# Rapid Fire with Multiple Targets
A Set of Weapons and Armor for Fudge also has rules for targeting an area with automatic weapons:
* Divide the covered area into "person spaces" (basically hexes in GURPS speak)
* Divide the total number of shots by the number of "person spaces"
  * Each "person space" has the potential to be targeted by that many shots
* Resolve the shots as if each person in the targeted area were targeted individually by the above calculated number of shots
  * Assess cumulative -1 penalty to each "person space" after the first

I think this should be fine. It isn't particularly difficult, but a minor simplification would be to have the attacker roll only once. Each target would need to defend separately, but it would reduce the number of attack rolls.

# Conclusion
I would need to see these rules in action to decide if they work well, but they are better than what I had before. The main things left to address for Fudge Psi-Wars are finishing vehicles and tackling supernatural abilities.
